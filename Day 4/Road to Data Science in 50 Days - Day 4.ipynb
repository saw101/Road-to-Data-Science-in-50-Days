    "# Estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "In statistics, **estimation** refers to the process by which one makes inferences about a population, based on information obtained from a sample.\n",
    "<div>\n",
    "<img src=\"https://slideplayer.com/slide/12804844/77/images/4/Point+and+Interval+Estimates.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"200\">\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "Point Estimate vs. Interval Estimate\n",
    "\n",
    "Statisticians use sample statistics to estimate population parameters. For example, sample means are used to estimate population means; sample proportions, to estimate population proportions.\n",
    "\n",
    "An estimate of a population parameter may be expressed in two ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Point estimate. A point estimate of a population parameter is a single value of a statistic. For example, the sample mean x is a point estimate of the population mean μ. Similarly, the sample proportion p is a point estimate of the population proportion P.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Interval estimate. An interval estimate is defined by two numbers, between which a population parameter is said to lie. For example, a < x < b is an interval estimate of the population mean μ. It indicates that the population mean is greater than a but less than b.\n",
    "\n",
    "Types\n",
    "Estimators can be described in several ways (click on the bold word for the main article on that term):\n",
    "\n",
    "* <a href=\"https://www.statisticshowto.com/what-is-bias/\"><b>Biased</b></a>: a statistic that is either an overestimate or an underestimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "* <a href=\"https://www.statisticshowto.com/efficient-estimator-efficiency/\"><b>Efficient</b></a>: a statistic with small variances (the one with the smallest possible variance is also called the “best”). Inefficient estimators can give you good results as well, but they usually requires much larger samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "* <a href=\"https://www.statisticshowto.com/scale-invariance/\"><b>Invariant</b></a>: statistics that are not easily changed by transformations, like simple data shifts.\n",
    "\n",
    "* <a href=\"https://www.statisticshowto.com/shrinkage-estimator/\"><b>Shrinkage</b></a>: a raw estimate that’s improved by combining it with other information. See also: The James-Stein estimator.\n",
    "\n",
    "* <a href=\"https://www.statisticshowto.com/sufficient-statistic/\"><b>Sufficient</b></a>: a statistic that estimates the population parameter as well as if you knew all of the data in all possible samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "* <a href=\"https://www.statisticshowto.com/unbiased/\"><b>UnBiased</b></a>: an accurate statistic that neither underestimates nor overestimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Confidence Intervals\n",
    "\n",
    "Statisticians use a confidence interval to express the precision and uncertainty associated with a particular sampling method. A confidence interval consists of three parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A confidence level.\n",
    "* A statistic.\n",
    "* A margin of error.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://cdn.analyticsvidhya.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/30111058/sampling_3.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The confidence level describes the uncertainty of a sampling method. The statistic and the margin of error define an interval estimate that describes the precision of the method. The interval estimate of a confidence interval is defined by the sample statistic + margin of error.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose we compute an interval estimate of a population parameter. We might describe this interval estimate as a 95% confidence interval. This means that if we used the same sampling method to select different samples and compute different interval estimates, the true population parameter would fall within a range defined by the sample statistic + margin of error 95% of the time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Confidence intervals are preferred to point estimates, because confidence intervals indicate \n",
    "(a) the precision of the estimate and (b) the uncertainty of the estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Formally, Confidence Interval is defined as: \n",
    "![](https://cdn.analyticsvidhya.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/30111025/image_11.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "whereas,  **X̄** = the sample mean\n",
    "\n",
    "**Z<subscript>a/2</subscript>**= Z value for desired confidence level α\n",
    "\n",
    "**σ** = the population standard deviation\n",
    "\n",
    "For an alpha value of 0.95 i.e 95% confidence interval, z=1.96.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Confidence Level\n",
    "The probability part of a confidence interval is called a confidence level. The confidence level describes the likelihood that a particular sampling method will produce a confidence interval that includes the true population parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is how to interpret a confidence level. Suppose we collected all possible samples from a given population, and computed confidence intervals for each sample. Some confidence intervals would include the true population parameter; others would not. A 95% confidence level means that 95% of the intervals contain the true population parameter; a 90% confidence level means that 90% of the intervals contain the population parameter; and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Margin of Error\n",
    "In a confidence interval, the range of values above and below the sample statistic is called the margin of error.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose the local newspaper conducts an election survey and reports that the independent candidate will receive 30% of the vote. The newspaper states that the survey had a 5% margin of error and a confidence level of 95%. These findings result in the following confidence interval: We are 95% confident that the independent candidate will receive between 25% and 35% of the vote.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Many public opinion surveys report interval estimates, but not confidence intervals. They provide the margin of error, but not the confidence level. To clearly interpret survey results you need to know both! We are much more likely to accept survey findings if the confidence level is high (say, 95%) than if it is low (say, 50%).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Interesting points to note about Confidence Intervals:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Confidence Intervals can be built with difference degrees of confidence suitable to a user’s needs like 70 %, 90% etc.\n",
    "* Greater the sample size, smaller the Confidence Interval, i.e more accurate determination of population mean from the sample means.\n",
    "* There are different confidence intervals for different sample means. For example, a sample mean of 40 will have a difference confidence interval from a sample mean of 45.\n",
    "* By 95% Confidence Interval, we do not mean that – The probability of a population mean to lie in an interval is 95%. Instead, 95% C.I means that 95% of the Interval estimates will contain the population statistic.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Many people do not have right knowledge about confidence interval and often interpret it incorrectly. So, I would like you to take your time visualizing the 4th argument and let it sink in.*\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "Too many technical terms has been introduced. Let's test our understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Which of the following statements is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "I. When the margin of error is small, the confidence level is high. <br>\n",
    "II. When the margin of error is small, the confidence level is low.<br>\n",
    "III. A confidence interval is a type of point estimate.<br>\n",
    "IV. A population mean is an example of a point estimate.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "(A) I only<br>\n",
    "(B) II only<br>\n",
    "(C) III only<br>\n",
    "(D) IV only.<br>\n",
    "(E) None of the above.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution**:\n",
    "The correct answer is (E). The confidence level is not affected by the margin of error. When the margin of error is small, the confidence level can low or high or anything in between. A confidence interval is a type of interval estimate, not a type of point estimate. A population mean is not an example of a point estimate; a sample mean is an example of a point estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Practical example\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculate the 95% confidence interval for a sample mean of 40 and sample standard deviation of 40 with sample size equal to 100.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution:\n",
    "\n",
    "We know, z-value for 95% C.I is 1.96. Hence, Confidence Interval (C.I) is calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "C.I= [{x(bar) – (z*s/√n)},{x(bar) – (z*s/√n)}]\n",
    "\n",
    "C.I = [{40-(1.96*40/10},{ 40+(1.96*40/10)}]\n",
    "\n",
    "C.I = [32.16, 47.84]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is the Standard Error?\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard error is an estimate of the standard deviation of a statistic. This lesson shows how to compute the standard error, based on sample data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard error is important because it is used to compute other measures, like confidence intervals and margins of error.\n",
    "\n",

    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have been introduced to a lot of technical terms, we enter the territory of one of the most important and critical part of statistics for researchers and data science in general i.e. **Hypothesis Testing**\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. Hypothesis Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "Before I get into the theoretical explanation, let us understand Hypothesis Testing by using a simple example.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: Class 8th has a mean score of 40 marks out of 100. The principal of the school decided that extra classes are necessary in order to improve the performance of the class. The class scored an average of 45 marks out of 100 after taking extra classes. Can we be sure whether the increase in marks is a result of extra classes or is it just random?\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1018/0*p3p9bovzJXb4bjdO.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothesis testing lets us identify that. It lets a sample statistic to be checked against a population statistic or statistic of another sample to study any intervention etc. Extra classes being the intervention in the above example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothesis testing is defined in two terms – *Null Hypothesis* and *Alternate Hypothesis*.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Null Hypothesis** being the sample statistic to be equal to the population statistic. For eg: The Null Hypothesis for the above example would be that the average marks after extra class are same as that before the classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Alternate Hypothesis** for this example would be that the marks after extra class are significantly different from that before the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothesis Testing is done on different levels of confidence and makes use of z-score to calculate the probability. So for a 95% Confidence Interval, anything above the z-threshold for 95% would reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Points to be noted:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We cannot accept the Null hypothesis, only reject it or fail to reject it.\n",
    "2. As a practical tip, Null hypothesis is generally kept which we want to disprove. For eg: You want to prove that students performed better after taking extra classes on their exam. The Null Hypothesis, in this case, would be that the marks obtained after the classes are same as before the classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Types of Errors in Hypothesis Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we have defined a basic Hypothesis Testing framework. It is important to look into some of the mistakes that are committed while performing Hypothesis Testing and try to classify those mistakes if possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, look at the Null Hypothesis definition above. What we notice at the first look is that it is a statement subjective to the tester like you and me and not a fact. That means there is a possibility that the Null Hypothesis can be true or false and we may end up committing some mistakes on the same lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two types of errors that are generally encountered while conducting Hypothesis Testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Type I error**: Look at the following scenario – A male human tested positive for being pregnant. Is it even possible? This surely looks like a case of False Positive. More formally, it is defined as the incorrect rejection of a True Null Hypothesis. The Null Hypothesis, in this case, would be – Male Human is not pregnant.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Type II error**: Look at another scenario where our Null Hypothesis is – A male human is pregnant and the test supports the Null Hypothesis.  This looks like a case of False Negative. More formally it is defined as the acceptance of a false Null Hypothesis.\n",

    "# 3. T-Tests\n",
    "\n",
    "T-tests are very much similar to the z-scores, the only difference being that instead of the Population Standard Deviation, we now use the Sample Standard Deviation. The rest is same as before, calculating probabilities on basis of t-values.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Sample Standard Deviation is given as:\n",
    "![](https://cdn.analyticsvidhya.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/30121520/eq_2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "where n-1 is the Bessel’s correction for estimating the population parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another difference between z-scores and t-values are that t-values are dependent on Degree of Freedom of a sample. Let us define what degree of freedom is for a sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Degree of Freedom** –  It is the number of variables that have the choice of having more than one arbitrary value. For example, in a sample of size 10 with mean 10, 9 values can be arbitrary but the 1oth value is forced by the sample mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "Points to note about the t-tests:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Greater the difference between the sample mean and the population mean, greater the chance of rejecting the Null Hypothesis. Why? (We discussed this above.)\n",
    "* Greater the sample size, greater the chance of rejection of Null Hypothesis.\n",

    "# 7. Correlation\n",
    "\n",
    "Correlation is used to test relationships between quantitative variables. In other words, it’s a measure of how things are related. The study of how variables are correlated is called correlation analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some examples of data that have a high correlation:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Your caloric intake and your weight.\n",
    "* Your eye color and your relatives’ eye colors.\n",
    "* The amount of time your study and your GPA.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some examples of data that have a low correlation (or none at all):\n",
    "\n",
    "* Your sexual preference and the type of cereal you eat.\n",
    "* A dog’s name and the type of dog biscuit they prefer.\n",
    "* The cost of a car wash and how long it takes to buy a soda inside the station.\n",
    "\n",
    "Correlations are useful because if you can find out what relationship variables have, you can make predictions about future behavior. Knowing what the future holds is very important in the social sciences like government and healthcare. Businesses also use these statistics for budgets and business plans.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7.1 The Correlation Coefficient\n",
    "\n",
    "A correlation coefficient is a way to put a value to the relationship. Correlation coefficients have a value of between -1 and 1. A “0” means there is no relationship between the variables at all, while -1 or 1 means that there is a perfect negative or positive correlation (negative or positive correlation here refers to the type of graph the relationship will produce).\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://www.statisticshowto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/pearson-2-small.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://www.mathsisfun.com/data/images/correlation-examples.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7.2 Types\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common correlation coefficient is the Pearson Correlation Coefficient. It’s used to test for linear relationships between data. In AP stats or elementary stats, the Pearson is likely the only one you’ll be working with. However, you may come across others, depending upon the type of data you are working with. For example, Goodman and Kruskal’s lambda coefficient is a fairly common coefficient. It can be symmetric, where you do not have to specify which variable is dependent, and asymmetric where the dependent variable is specified.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7.3 Correlation vs Covariance\n",
    "\n",
    "This has been explained very well by one of my connection on Linkedin - <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/chayankathuria/\">Chayan Kathuria</a>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Correlation and Covariance** are often confused with each other. They are similar but tell different characteristics of the data. ⁉️\n",
    "\n",
    "Correlation and Covariance both the terms measure the relationship and the dependency between two variables. 💡\n",
    "\n",
    "Covariance defines the direction of the variance or the relationship between 2 variables. If Covariance is 0, it means that the variables have no variance with respect to each other. This would mean they are not related and provide completely different information about data.\n",
    "\n",
    "If it is positive, it means that one variable increases as the other increases (directly proportional) and if it is negative, then one of the variables decreases as the other increases (inversely proportional).📈\n",
    "\n",
    "Correlation, on the other hand, also defines the magnitude of the relation between 2 variables. Correlation is nothing but the covariance divided by the standard deviations of the variables. Hence, the value of correlation lies between -1 and 1. 📉\n",
    "\n",
    "-1 being a complete inverse proportionality and 1 being a complete direct proportionality. And such variables won't add any more information to the data.\n",
